Custom Framework Animated Cursor

This repo was made to contain my personal designs for a Framework Laptop themed Cursor Pack for Windows.
I used the official Framework .svg logo from Wikipedia and [this](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/windows-10-aero-black-1) cursor pack as a reference.
Some of the original cursors .ico files were not touched at all, while others (unavailable, busy, background) were made from scratch using [this](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker) tool.
You can download the whole set via the .zip in the release section, and there are some references so you can do your own!
final designs contains only the edited .icos.;
sources contains all the material used to create the custom ones;
previews contains the .gif so you can see what you're installing.
