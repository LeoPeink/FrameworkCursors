Custom Framework Animated Cursor

This repo was made to contain my personal designs for a Framework Laptop themed Cursor Pack for Windows.
I used the official Framework .svg logo from Wikipedia and [this](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/windows-10-aero-black-1) cursor pack as a reference.
Some of the original cursors .ico files were not touched at all, while others (unavailable, busy, background) were made from scratch using [this](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker) tool.
You can download the whole set via the .zip in the release section, and there are some references so you can do your own!
