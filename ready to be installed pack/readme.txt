Author's description:

I have created a modified version of the Aero Noir dark theme. This version that I have modified has black animated wheels and unavailable cursor role. I have recoloured those cursor roles with a third party software application called Sib Cursor Editor. The reason why I have used this software is because RW Cursor Editor does not have the ability to recolour cursors in black.

The name "noir" means "black" in French, so keep that in mind. I have named this cursor set "Aero Noir Dark Theme" because this is a modified version of this cursor set. I have done that to avoid confusion with the original name for the original set.

The animation on the animated cursors may be a little difficult to properly spot on some monitors. However, on modern computer screens, the animation colours should be clearly visible.

The original cursor set is missing the Precision and Text Select cursor roles. That is why I have added them in this set to make a complete cursor set for Windows 10. Users are going to need to upgrade to the 19H1 build of Windows 10, or above, to use the Location and Person cursor roles.

Lovers of the dark theme mode in Windows 10 or users who simply likes to create black themes in Windows 10 can enjoy downloading this cursor set so that they can have a fully black Windows 10 set to fit in with their own custom themes.

Please note that this cursor set supports multiple resolutions for best usage and performance in Windows 10.

This cursor set has been originally uploaded on the DeviantArt website. The uploader author is called SpringsTS. I have already requested permission to SpringsTS to give me permission to upload this Aero Noir cursor set on the RealWorld website. I have set my license to "Custom (contact author)" because this is the appropriate license to use for this black cursor set.

Enjoy the truly dark theme mode that all those 17 cursor roles have to offer.
